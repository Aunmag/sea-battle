### About

This is my first game since 2016.03.12. While I was been learning GUI I decided to make this test project. Just worked only with code.

For now AI can't distinguish and chase damaged ships. To compensate this AI has (intuition) 0.02 chance to see your one unit ship.

You can't put your new ships manually. In the begging you only can regenerate random positions of ships.
