### About
Sea Battle (battleship) - my first text-based game, which I'd started to develop at February 2016. While I was been learning GUI, I decided to make this test project to code practicing. And some time later I was back to have all done completely and tweak some defects.

Notice that you may not arrange your ships manually. In the begging you can only shuffle their position randomly.

- After game start you take turn first
- You may press Ctrl+C to exit game at any time
- Source code available [here](https://github.com/aunmag/sea-battle/)
