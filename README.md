### About
Sea Battle (battleship) - my first text-based game, which I'd started to develop at February 2016. While I have been learning GUI, I decided to make this test project to practice coding. After some time I came back to finish and correct some defects.

Notice that you may not arrange your ships manually. In the begging you can only shuffle their position randomly.

- After game start you take turn first
- You may press Ctrl+C to exit game at any time
- Source code available [here](https://github.com/aunmag/sea-battle/)
